################################################################################


#' Delete Link
#' 
#' This function deletes a link between a unique question ID (uqid) and one or more question IDs.
#' 
#' @param conn A database connection object.
#' @param uqid Unique question ID to delete link from.
#' @param question_id_list A list of question IDs to be unlinked.
#' @return NULL
#' 
#' @details This function deletes the link between the specified uqid and question IDs, 
#' moves the affected records to the "unlinked" table temporarily, deletes the target records, 
#' removes any records in "unlinked" that are still present in the "linked" table, 
#' logs the deleted links, and updates the "unlinked" table.
#' 
#' @assertion The number of unique questions in newly_unlinked should be the same as 
#' the number of questions in question_id_list.
#' 

deleteLink <- function(conn, uqid, question_id_list) {
  #' ADD ASSERTION HERE THAT THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE QUESTIONS IN newly_unlinked
  #' IS THE SAME AS THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS IN question_id_list
