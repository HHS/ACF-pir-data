#' Determine whether two questions are considered linked
#' 
#' `determineLink` determines whether two questions are considered
#' linked by measuring the edit distance between their question numbers,
#' names, texts, and sections. 
#' 
#' The following logic is used to determine whether two questions link:
#' 1) The questions are in the same section.
#' 2) Two of the following metrics are identical for the questions: number,
#' name, text.
#' 3) The question to be linked has only one match or if there are multiple
#' matches, they all meet the criteria above (as in the case where a question
#' number changes across years, but question name and text remain the same.)
#' @param df A cross joined question data frame.
#' @returns A data frame with confirmed question links.
