# PIR Pipeline

## Overview
This package is designed to streamline PIR survey data analysis. The pipeline accepts data in .xlsx or .xls formats and ingests it into a MySQL database. Questions can then be linked across years providing some longitudinal view of the data. The package includes an R Shiny dashboard that allows for exploration and review of the data. Please note that this package is currently designed for single-user environments and is not compatible with cloud-based systems out of the box.
